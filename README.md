# Todo-App-CRUD
 
 This is a TODO/Task Managing App. The UI is polished.
 User can perform all four CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations in it and add time to his tasks.
 User can also mark his tasks done.
 There are two screens: one where user has his pending tasks, and one where his completed tasks are displayed. 
 User can perform CRUD operations on both screens.
